        <p>Attention fans, haters, and concerned citizens: the US Senate is considering amking streaming any copyrighted material a felony &ndash; even something as harmless as singing a song by someone else.</p>
        <p>Under this law, Justin Bieber could face 5 years in jail (for singing others' R&B songs in the YouTube videos that made him famous).</p>
        <p>It's ridiculous, but it's true. This law threatens jail time for millions of tinternet users who express themselves with video. We have to stop it!</p>

        <p>The Senate has no business turning internet users into felons for expressing themselves online. Jail for singing a song? Ridiculous! Free Bieber. Vote no on S. 978</p>

                <span class="question">Could Justin Bieber really got o jail?</span>
                <span class="answer">Yes, for up to 5 years. Bieber became famous singing others' songs on YouTube. Copyright law is so extreme, just <em>singing</em> one of these songs in public without permission is infringment. Since he posted them hoping to start a career, it's commercial infringement (that's crazy, but it's the law).</span>

    <h2>Could This Really Happen?</h2>

    <p>make posting videos of songs and other content a felony -- with up to 5 years in prison.</p> 
    <p>But wait... didn't Justin Bieber get famous by posting YouTube videos of him singing copyrighted songs? That's right, he certainly did, and those videos are still on his YouTube account. If this bill passes, he'll be committing a felony, and he could get 5 years in jail.</p>
